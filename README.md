**Powered by [Capitaine](https://github.com/Lucineer/capitaine) · [Cocapn](https://github.com/Lucineer/cocapn)**

The repo IS the agent. travlog-ai is a cocapn vessel — a self-improving repository that runs on Cloudflare Workers, thinks with LLMs, and coordinates with the fleet through git.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Fork and deploy
gh repo fork Lucineer/travlog-ai --clone
cd travlog-ai
npx wrangler login
echo "your-github-token" | npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
echo "your-llm-key" | npx wrangler secret put DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
npx wrangler deploy
```

That's it. The vessel is alive.

## Features

- **BYOK v2** — Zero keys in code. All API keys via Cloudflare Secrets Store.
- **Multi-model** — DeepSeek, SiliconFlow, DeepInfra, Moonshot, z.ai, local models.
- **Session memory** — Conversations persist and build context over time.
- **PII safety** — Automatic detection and dehydration of sensitive data.
- **Rate limiting** — Guest tokens per IP with configurable limits.
- **Health checks** — Standard `/health` endpoint on all vessels.
- **Fleet coordination** — CRP-39 protocol for trust, bonds, and events.

## Architecture

Single-file Cloudflare Worker. Zero runtime dependencies. Inline HTML serving.

```
src/
  worker.ts      # The hull — serves users, runs heartbeats
lib/
  byok.ts        # Multi-model routing (BYOK v2)
  ...
```

## The Fleet

travlog-ai is one of 40+ autonomous vessels in the Lucineer fleet. Each vessel is a different domain of one intelligence.

## Philosophy

> The repo is the agent. The agent is the repo. Intelligence crystallizes from fluid (LLM calls) to solid (code). The vessel becomes faster and cheaper as it becomes smarter.

- **Fork-first** — Power users fork and customize. Casual users visit the domain.
- **Pay-for-convenience** — We save you costs through bulk inference, not markups.
- **Git as coordination** — Agents compete via PRs, not chat.
- **Soft actualization** — Vessels evolve gently based on usage, not hard updates.
